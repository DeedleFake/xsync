// A Queue concurrently collects values and returns them in FIFO
// order. A zero value Queue is ready to use.
//
// A Queue is stopped when it is garbage collected. Therefore, a
// reference to the Queue must be kept alive during its use or its
// behavior will become undefined. Because of that, it is recommended
// to access the Queue's channels via the methods every time instead
// of storing a copy somewhere.
//
// A Queue is initialized by calling any of its methods, so a copy of
// a Queue made before those methods are called is a completely
// independent Queue, while a copy made afterwards is the same Queue.
//
// If a Queue's contents contain any references to the Queue itself,
// it can cause garbage collection to fail. For example, given a
// Queue[func()], if the Queue contains any closures which reference
// the actual instance of the Queue, the Queue's finalizer will not
// run until those elements have been removed from the Queue. Because
// of this, such a Queue will need to be manually stopped with a call
// to Queue.Stop.
